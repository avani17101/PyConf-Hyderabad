# PyConf-Hyderabad
My leanings at PyConf Hyderabad

The COnference took place between 7-8 December at IIIT Hyderabad. Most of the people attending it were working professionals and it had keynotes from great Data Scientists, Researchers, AI/ML Entusiasts inlcuding winners of verious Hackathons, Entrepreneurs and working professionals who are experts in various fields.

There were varois tracks running at different venues in IIIT Hyderabad including workshops, Talks, Seminars and activities at Open spaces.

Some of which I attended.
Day 1
* Buliding ML Applications with Grammex.
by Bhanu K
He really taught wel and here is a link to its workshop repo https://github.com/gramexrecipes/gramex-ml-workshop

*Building Recommender System in Python 
by Dr. Sarbjot Singh Anand
He was even a Keynote Speaker and is highly knowlegable. He is founder of Tatras https://tatrasdata.com/ Lab based Data Consultancy servies along with being an Associate Professor at the University of Warwick and previous academic posts in the United Kingdom and has published more than 90 academic papers. His work is mainly in helping various problems faced by common people. 
In this talk he told about various recommneder systems strategies and dealing with user bais on data etc.

*Decrypting ML models with Lime
by Laisha Wadhwa
This was a really enligthening talk and I enjoyed a lot while getting to learn about a framework called Lime which makes it easy for Data Sceintists to get an insight on what the model is learning and how its learning pictorially. Now why its important. It makes the process of going through data to tune parameters way easy with its detailed analysis on UI and, its pretty easy. We just need to import Lime in our Python Scripts!
Here's how to do it - https://github.com/laishawadhwa/PyConf-2019---Lime-Workshop

Day 2
Key takeways
*Keynote by Dr. Sarbjot Singh Anand.
Here he talked about various ML/AI trends, basics of ML/AI and gave this insights on each one of them. Not to mention his way of teaching was just OUTSTANDING.

*DIfferentiable Programming 
by Srikumar Subramanian
This is a new field and requires to be really worked on. An important feature of NN's is Backpropagation and training throguh multiple batches. A typical Neural Network goes through many Batches and Iterations of adjusting and readjusting of weights before converging. It's computation depends on how fast gradient descent converges. It becomes computationally impossible to go through many batches of when data is really really big.
heres where faster convergence is required and Differential programming comes in play. 

*Scalable Automated Machine Learning with H2O in Pyhon
by Parul Pandey
H2O is a open soruce library which can be imported and used in Python to get a hand over varoius models in ML. It is usefull for selecting which model is better for a particular problem with a particular Dataset. It trains varoius ML models from XGBoost to Naive bayes to Decision Trees on our data and ranks them based on their various performace metrics. It is easy to undertand and use and has commands quite similar to Pandas.
Check this outand startb using this awesome library :)

*Machine Learning in Healthcare
by Saurabh Khandelwal
He has worked in Stanford lab and was really knowledgable.
He talked about importance of ML in Healthcae, advancements in this field, his work at Stanford and mojor challenges faced in this feild.
ML is more data biased and it becomes really difficult when model is trained on a different dataset(say people of a different terrain) and then used to diagnose and prdict people of certain terrain. 
Varoious major challenges acocrding to him are:
 * Black Box
 * Garbage in Garbage out
 * Shifting Distributions
He talked about use of Inception Networks and explainable AI in healthcare.

*Why is Problem Solving in the enterprise difficult from Chess, Go, Imagenet or kaggle Challenges.
by Vikas Agrawal
